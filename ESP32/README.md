# HOW TO USE THIS

In the `Libraries` directory of the Arduino IDE sketchbook location place a folder which contains the contents of `../src`. Then to import the library you can use something like `#include <VSC_everything.h>`.

# NOTES

- `icosphere` is memory intensive. Going above two subdivision levels is not recommended.
